\cvsection{Summary}

\begin{cvparagraph}
I’m a passionate computer programmer with Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science and nearly 18 years 
of practical experience on several IT platforms and programming languages, creating and maintaining 
products / on-demand projects throughout all software life cycle / ecosystems. 
I always do my best about \textbf{everything} I’m committed to accomplish, no matter I’m an expert 
or not on what it has to be done. Between 2006-2013 I owned a small consultancy company 
($[gm]^2$ Intelligent Systems), which was focused mostly on R\&D, machine learning and time series forecasting.
